# Data Structures Project

A collection of C++ implementations for various data structures.

## Introduction

This project aims to provide a comprehensive set of C++ implementations for different data structures. Whether you're studying data structures or looking for reusable components, this collection offers well-documented and almost finished implementations of key structures.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `AVLTree.cpp` - Implementation of an AVL tree.
- `AVLTree.h` - Header file for the AVL tree implementation.
- `Binary_Tree.cpp` - Implementation of a binary tree.
- `Binary_Tree.h` - Header file for the binary tree implementation.
- `CMakeLists.txt` - CMake configuration for building the project.
- `Hash_Table.h` - Header file for a hash table.
- `Ordered_Array.cpp` - Implementation of an ordered array.
- `Ordered_Array.h` - Header file for the ordered array implementation.
- `README.md` - Project documentation (you are here).
- `Unordered_Array.cpp` - Implementation of an unordered array.
- `Unordered_Array.h` - Header file for the unordered array implementation.
- `main.cpp` - A sample main program showcasing the usage of implemented data structures.
- `node.h` - Header file for a generic node structure.

## Implemented Data Structures

1. AVL Tree
2. Binary Tree
3. Hash Table
4. Ordered Array
5. Unordered Array


## Project Goals and Achievements

The driving force behind this project was a personal quest to deepen my understanding of essential data structures within the C++ programming paradigm. The key objectives guiding this solo endeavor include:

- **Personal Learning Journey:** The primary goal was to embark on a personal learning journey to master the intricacies of various data structures. Implementing them from scratch provided invaluable insights into algorithms, data organization, and optimization strategies.

- **Skill Development:** By developing these structures independently, I honed my coding skills and gained hands-on experience in memory management, pointer manipulation, and algorithmic efficiency.

- **Algorithmic Complexity:** Each implementation in this collection was meticulously crafted with a focus on algorithmic complexity. Balancing functionality and performance, I ensured that the implementations consider factors such as time and space complexity.

- **Resource for Others:** Beyond personal development, this project aims to serve as a resource for fellow developers. The implementations are designed as reusable components, providing a solid foundation for those seeking reliable data structures in their projects.

## Personal Investment

The "cost" of this project is measured in the time, dedication, and intellectual effort invested during this solo journey. The commitment to creating high-quality, well-documented implementations required persistent exploration, problem-solving, and a passion for the intricacies of data structures.

This project stands as a personal achievement and a testament to the commitment to continuous learning and improvement in the dynamic field of computer science.
